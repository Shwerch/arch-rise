# My installation scripts for Arch Linux.
I chose Arch Linux as an experience in building a system that I could know 100% about, and that would be as bloat-free as possible.

Installs Arch Linux with a GRUB bootloader with an encrypted all partitions included /boot in a ext4 encryted filesystem with a ZRAM, KDE Plasma desktop environment, pipewire, AMD RADV videodriver and a set of programs that include Ungoogled Chromium, VSCodium, OnlyOffice, and more.

I created it based on the Arch WIki and some guides. You can use these scripts to explore ArchLinux and install it.

If you want to use this, you need to learn the scripts. To do this, use the git clone command. You can change the values of some variables in them at will. Please note that the script postinstall.sh you need to run it manually on the installed system after the installation is complete.

I tried to make the scripts easy to read. If you don't understand something, the Arch Wiki will help you.
